                        There are many apps out there that are not on this list, and we cannot vouch for any of them. If you are going to try an unknown app, be sure to follow best
                        practices to avoid getting scammed or downloading malware. We cannot make any promises about the safety of phone apps to make money or other methods that
                        are not listed in this article. If you do decide to try an app not listed here, we have some simple guidelines to help you protect yourself.
                    </p>

                    <p class="article__content__paragraph">
                        Some of the best ways to protect yourself online include:
                        <li>Thoroughly review user reviews on app stores or other trusted sites on the internet.</li>
                        <li>
                            Check to be sure that the app does not ask for permissions it does not need. If an app is looking for access to your emails, calls, or personal
                            information and it does not seem to need those to function that could be a red flag. Investigate the app further.
                        </li>
                        <li>Check to see how many downloads an app has. An app that has a lot of downloads without a lot of bad reviews is more likely to be legit.</li>
                        <li>
                            Android users can take advantage of anti-malware software. Be sure to use a program from a trusted cybersecurity vendor. For iOS users, the operating
                            system has lots of built in protections that help but also keep anti-malware from being functional.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use common sense. The biggest thing you can do to protect yourself is to remember that if something looks too good to be true, it likely is. Promises of
                            large amounts of income with little work or investment is a major red flag.
                        </li>

                    </p>
                    <p class="article__content__paragraph">
                        If you pay attention to those rules and avoid high risk apps and methods, you can make money from your phone with ease. Of course, the best way is to use
                        the methods we list here and have confirmed as legitimate and safe.
