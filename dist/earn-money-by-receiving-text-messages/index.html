                    <p class="article__content__bolder">
                        Have you ever wished you could make money with very little to no effort at all? Of course you have! What if you could earn money for receiving text messages
                        to your phone? Luckily, that is now possible. In this article, we are going to show you the best ways to make money by getting text messages as we examine
                        the top 3 apps available.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="article__content__h3">How Is It Possible To Get Paid For Receiving Text Messages</h2>
                    <p class="article__content__paragraph">
                        Online businesses and services all over the world use SMS messages to communicate information to their users. These services have to be constantly running
                        and stable, which means they need to be tested regularly to ensure that they are functioning reliably. To do this, they have to send test SMS messages to
                        numbers and see that they are being received.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article__content__paragraph">
                        Because of this need for testing, you can get paid for receiving text messages on your cell phone. Companies will send you SMS messages that you will not
                        even need to read. All you need to do is receive SMS and earn money passively. Some apps even let you sell your unused SMS messages. These apps give you a
                        great opportunity to put some extra money in your pocket.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="article__content__h3">Are These Apps To Earn Money By Receiving SMS Legit?</h2>
                    <p class="article__content__paragraph">
                        Obviously, an opportunity to make money by receiving text messages sounds too good to be true at first. It is important to be skeptical of anything that
                        makes big promises to make you money on the internet, especially if they want you to install an app or program onto your phone. There are a lot of scams and
                        malware out there looking to take advantage of people who are looking for an opportunity. Here are a few things you should check before installing an app:
                    </p>

                    <p class="article__content__paragraph">
                        <strong>Reviews</strong> - One of the first, and easiest, items for you to check when evaluating the legitimacy of an app is to look up reviews of it on the
                        internet. Look on the app store you find the app on, or if it isn’t on the app store look at reviews on other websites. See what people are saying, look up
                        the history of the company, and look for red flags. Red flags may include people saying that the app is malicious, dangerous, or that they were hacked soon
                        after downloading.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article__content__paragraph">
                        <strong>Use An Anti-Malware Solution (Android)</strong> - Android users can download anti-malware scanners that look for suspicious activity and files.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article__content__paragraph">
                        <strong>Look at the Permissions</strong> - Make sure that the app doesn't ask for permissions that are not needed. Obviously, apps to earn money by
                        receiving text messages will often need permission to read SMS messages. But, if they are seeking permissions that seem suspicious you should investigate
                        further.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article__content__paragraph">
                        <strong> Check The Downloads</strong> - See the number of downloads the app has. The more downloads it has without a lot of bad reviews, the more likely the
                        app is to be legit.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article__content__paragraph">
                        To make things easier, all of the apps we are recommending in the next section are legit and safe. You can make money from SMS receiving and be in safe
                        hands with each of these options.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="article__content__h3">3 Best Apps To Earn Money By Receiving SMS</h2>
                    <p class="article__content__paragraph">
                        Now that we know that it is possible to make money by getting text messages, what are the best apps to use? We are going to take a look at the 3 best apps
                        to earn money by receiving SMS, and give some of the pros and cons for each one to equip you to choose the right app for you.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="article__content__h4">1. Cash4sms (Android)</h3>
                    <p class="article__content__paragraph">

                    <p class="article__content__paragraph">
                        <strong>Pros:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p class="article__content__paragraph">
                        <strong>Easy To Use</strong> - As long as your phone has an active internet connection, all you need to do is set up the app and then just sit back and earn
                        money by receiving SMS.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article__content__paragraph">
                        <strong><a href="https://cash4sms.today/best-birdchain-alternative/">Best BirdChain Alternative</a></strong> - Birdchain is a
                        blockchain based app that lets users sell unused SMS. Cash4sms also lets you make money on your unused SMS, but it lets you collect money with direct cash
                        earnings through Paypal instead of only earning cryptocurrency with Birdchain. Cash4sms is also available in more countries than Birdchain.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article__content__paragraph">
                        <strong>Available Almost Anywhere In The World</strong> - There are many apps that let you get paid to receive text messages that are only available in a
                        limited number of countries. Cash4sms lets you make money receiving text messages from almost any location in the world.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article__content__paragraph">
                        <strong> Cons: </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p class="article__content__paragraph">
                        <strong>Incoming SMS Not Guaranteed</strong> - While Cash4sms tries to make sure everyone has the opportunity to get paid for receiving text messages,
                        sometimes incoming SMS are not going to come in on a regular basis.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article__content__paragraph">
                        <strong>App Does Not Work For Everyone</strong> - Cash4sms makes every effort to be as accessible as possible, but not everyone will be able to benefit from
                        the app. In some countries the app may not be available. For Outgoing SMS, if your carrier charges more than 0,5 Eurocents for SMS sent to other countries, the
                        services will not be appropriate for you.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article__content__paragraph">
                        Cash4sms is our top pick because it stands out as unique among other apps that let you make money receiving text messages. The ability to make money selling
                        unused SMS, and its simplicity to use, are unmatched by the competition.
                    </p>

                        <strong>Platform:</strong> Android <br />
                        <strong>Earnings:</strong> 0,5-3 Eurocents cents per message

                    <h3 class="article__content__h4">2. Ispyplates (Android, iOS, Others)</h3>
                    <p class="article__content__paragraph">
                        Ispyplates is a little different from the other apps on this list due to the types of texts you will receive. While you still earn money by receiving SMS
                        messages, instead of getting test messages from providers you will receive marketing texts from companies. You can choose to interact with these deals,
                        offers, and messages; but you do not have to in order to earn money. They do not say how much money you earn per text, though some users have reported
                        earning $100-1000 USD a month.
