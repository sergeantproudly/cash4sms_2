<h3>THE SUBJECT OF THE TERMS</h3>
<p>The Cash4SMS application should be loaded by the User to his/her Android device to send monthly a                    predetermined number of text messages to specific European mobile phone numbers operated by                    TELENUMBERS HOLDINGS LTD and/or its partners, within the current tariff plan of mobile operator whose                    SIM-card is used in the User&rsquo;s device, for a fee paid by Cash4SMS per each SMS sent thereby.</p>
<h3>APPLICATION OF THE TERMS</h3>
<p>These Terms are a legally binding document and agreement governing the relationships between the User                    and the Company, arising out of the Service use upon text messages sending by the User.</p>
<p><strong>ACCOUNT &amp; REGISTRATION PROCEDURE</strong></p>
<p>After the User downloads and installs the Application on his/her device with the Android OS, he/she                    can launch it and register its Account by indicating his/her name, date of birth, country of                    residence.</p>
<p>Thereat, the application automatically identifies and memorizes the User&rsquo;s phone number, which                    is planned to be used subsequently by the Service, including the purpose of communication with the                    User, such as eventual calls, SMS sending to him/her, e.g. marketing and/or advertising                    notifications (with the User&rsquo;s consent and/or otherwise within the framework of applicable                    law), PUSH notifications, etc.</p>
<p>After the registration information is entered, a mobile Application will connect to the server of                    Cash4SMS Service and transfer to it the User&rsquo;s registration data, as well as try to send                    several test SMS messages from the User&rsquo;s smartphone to the &lsquo;test&rsquo; mobile numbers                    of the Cash4SMS network. Accordingly, such messages will be charged by the User&rsquo;s mobile                    operator as provided by the current supported tariff plan.</p>
<p>If test messages are delivered successfully, the User&rsquo;s registration will be completed and the                    User will receive a notification that he/she can successfully start using the Service.</p>
<p>If test messages delivery failed, the User will be also registered by the system, however the User                    will receive a notification that the Service is not available to him/her at that moment. Thereat,                    the User will be also notified that the –êpplication on a regular basis (monthly) continues test                    SMS-messages sending in the background mode, while the User is or stays logged in. In this case,                    messages will be charged by the User&rsquo;s mobile operator as provided by the current supported                    tariff plan. Just after the testing results are successful, the Application will notify the User                    about it as well as about the Service availability to the User from then on.</p>
<p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to decide on the User&rsquo;s account opening,                    including the cases when it is required or recommended by applicable governmental, regulatory or law                    enforcement requirements, where applicable.</p>
<p>The Service shall be used exceptionally by the owners of registered profiles. You agree that the                    information you provide to us under the procedure of account creation and under any subsequent                    identification/verification procedures is accurate and complete and will be updated from time to                    time, if necessary and as appropriate.</p>
<p>To be able to use our Service, you should indicate an actual mobile phone number. You agree to                    receive SMS/text messages from us as a part of the use of the Service and communication with you. We                    do not charge for SMS/text messages. Standard charges rates for messaging via mobile devices may be                    applied by the mobile operator. Failure to provide an actual mobile phone number may result in                    limitation of the use of the Service. If we suspect that your mobile number is out of the                    service/invalid or you use the VOIP service to circumvent this requirement as an actual mobile                    number provision, we may suspend or otherwise restrict your use of the Service.</p>
<h3>AUTHORIZED USE OF THE SERVICE</h3>
<p>You bear responsibility for making sure that personal information in your profile (User&rsquo;s                    account in the Service) is up to date, true and accurate, including your email address and mobile                    phone number (if necessary, in accordance with these Terms).</p>
<p>You are also responsible for maintaining appropriate security, control and confidentiality of your                    profile information, including any personal data, identification numbers (PIN), passwords, or other                    confidential data associated with your profile, as well as for performing any actions in this                    profile.</p>

<p>We shall not be liable for any losses you incurred as a result of non-compliance with the                    instructions set out in this section, or any notices or warnings sent by us.</p>
<h3>SMS SENDING PARAMETERS</h3>
<p>After successful registration, the User will be enabled to determine the SMS sending parameters,                    indicating what number of text messages can be sent by the Cash4SMS Application per day or per month                    from the User&rsquo;s device. Where the number of text messages is indicated per month, this                    quantity will be divided in proportion to the number of days in a month.</p>
<p><em><u>Please note:</u></em> The Cash4SMS Application, on its own, will notify You of your Payout                    Rate set by the Cash4SMS per each text message sent from your device to Cash4SMS phone numbers. This                    means that You will not be able to choose a Payout Rate parameters by yourself. Please, refer to the                    &ldquo;FEES&rdquo; section below for further details.</p>
<p>The User is allowed, at any point, to stop sending text messages, as well as change the SMS sending                    parameters (except for the Payout Rate, as stated above).</p>
<p>Likewise, the SMS sending will cease automatically, if text messages are sent but, for any reason,                    not delivered to the Cash4SMS mobile numbers. The User will receive a respective notification of                    that and the Cash4SMS Application, therefore, will proceed in a test mode. Thereat, the User will be                    also notified that the –êpplication on a regular basis (monthly) continues test SMS-messages sending                    in the background mode, while the User is or stays logged in. In this case, messages will be charged                    by the User&rsquo;s mobile operator as provided by the current supported tariff plan. Just after the                    testing results are successful, the Application will notify the User about it as well as about the                    Service availability to the User from then on.</p>
<h3>FEES</h3>
<p>By starting SMS sending in accordance with the predetermined parameters, the User launches the                    Cash4SMS Application work and further can see the Payout amounts to be calculated by Cash4SMS                    Service per each message sent and successfully delivered to Cash4SMS mobile numbers.</p>
<p>SMS messages will be sent in the background mode in accordance with the settings chosen and                    customized by the User, being charged by the User&rsquo;s mobile operator as provided by the current                    tariff plan supported.</p>
<p>The Cash4SMS Application, on its own, will notify the User of his/her Payout Rate set by the Cash4SMS                    Service per each text message sent from the User&rsquo;s device to Cash4SMS phone numbers, without                    letting the User to choose the Payout Rate.</p>
<p>The Cash4SMS Service may unilaterally change the User&rsquo;s Payout Rate, notifying the User of such                    change on the date of the tariff change. The SMS sending will be suspended until the User confirms                    an updated tariff.</p>
<p>The User can review the statistics of sent messages in the Application.</p>
<p>The Fee assigned to the User will be calculated every 1st day of the month, based on the amount of                    text messages sent in the preceding month. The disbursement of calculated funds should be                    implemented on the same day by the payment method indicated (if so) by the User in the Cash4SMS                    Application. If payment data were not indicated or were indicated erroneously and the payment cannot                    be carried out, then the User may amend his/her payment data and make an iterated request for the                    Payout. Thereat, the Cash4SMS Service is not responsible for the payments to another or third party                    payment data already carried out by the User&rsquo;s error.</p>
<h3>DISCLAIMERS</h3>
<p>The User bears full, sole and primary responsibility to the User&rsquo;s mobile operator for text                    messages sent through the Cash4SMS Application. It is the User&rsquo;s full responsibility to                    familiarize himself/herself, on his/her own, with the tariff plan of his/her mobile operator and                    settle accounts with him on the basis of current established tariffs.</p>
<p>The Cash4SMS Service does not warrant the constancy of Payout Rates. You acknowledge and agree that                    Cash4SMS may unilaterally change the User&rsquo;s Payout Rate, notifying the User of such change on                    the date of the tariff change.</p>
