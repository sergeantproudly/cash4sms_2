Although the money is deposited into PayPal or in euros through the PayPal app it is extremely easy to convert the Euro cash into u.s. dollars. I have recommended this app to all of my friends and family. And to the cash out family I just thank you for this app it has been a great help to me and I appreciate customer service and how quickly they respond to any question that I may have. Keep up the good work.

                            p.reviews__review__description His has to be one of my favorite money making apps. It's fast, easy to use, has a low payout threshold, and quickly pays out to your PayPal account. I have had the app for about a month and have withdrawn 5 times and received the automatic monthly payment 1 time, for a total of 6 payouts. As for people complaining about it "taking their money" the app clearly states when you are setting it up that it uses intl text credits, if you don't have intl unlimited plan I wouldn't recommend using it.
